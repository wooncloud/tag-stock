# TagStock Chrome Extension: The Complete Guide to Faster Uploads

The TagStock Chrome Extension is your secret weapon for cutting upload time in half. Instead of switching between tools to copy-paste metadata, the extension works directly on Adobe Stock and Shutterstock upload pages—analyzing your images and filling in titles and keywords automatically.

This comprehensive guide walks you through everything from installation to advanced usage.

## What the Chrome Extension Does

The TagStock Chrome Extension adds a powerful **Side Panel** to your Chrome browser that:

- **Detects** which stock platform you're on (Adobe Stock or Shutterstock)
- **Analyzes** the image currently selected on the upload page
- **Generates** AI-powered titles and keywords using Google Gemini
- **Fills** the metadata form fields automatically
- **Saves** your changes with one click

All of this happens without leaving the stock site upload page.

## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Download the Extension

Download the TagStock Chrome Extension package from your [TagStock Dashboard](/dashboard). The extension is available exclusively for Pro plan subscribers.

### Step 2: Install in Chrome

Since the extension is currently distributed as a developer package, follow these steps:

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer Mode** by toggling the switch in the top-right corner
3. Click **"Load unpacked"** button
4. Select the `dist` folder from the downloaded extension package
5. The TagStock icon will appear in your Chrome toolbar

> **Tip:** Pin the TagStock extension to your toolbar for quick access. Click the puzzle piece icon (🧩) in Chrome's toolbar, find TagStock, and click the pin icon.

### Step 3: Sign In

1. Click the TagStock icon in your toolbar to open the Side Panel
2. The Side Panel will display a loading screen while checking your account
3. Click **"Continue with Google"** to sign in with your TagStock account
4. Once authenticated, you'll see your email, plan type, and remaining credits

## Understanding the Side Panel Interface

The TagStock Side Panel is your command center. Here's what each section does:

### Header

The top bar displays the TagStock logo and version. You'll find three icons:

- 🏠 **Home** — Opens the TagStock website
- 💬 **Contact** — Opens the contact page for support
- 🚪 **Sign Out** — Signs you out of the extension

### User Info & Credits

Below the header, you'll see:

- **Your email address** — The account you're signed in with
- **Plan type** — "Free Plan" or "Pro Plan"
- **Credits remaining** — Each AI metadata generation uses 1 credit

> **Note:** If your credits are running low, a yellow warning banner will appear reminding you to upgrade or wait for your monthly credit refresh.

### Current Page Status

This card shows whether the extension recognizes the current page:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ Ready | You're on a supported upload page—ready to generate metadata |
| ⚠️ Unsupported | The current page isn't a recognized stock site upload page |
| 🔍 Checking... | The extension is analyzing the current page |

### Fill Metadata Button

The main action button. When active, it:

1. Captures the currently selected image from the upload page
2. Sends it to Google Gemini AI for analysis
3. Generates a title and relevant keywords
4. Fills the form fields on the page automatically
5. Triggers auto-save after a short delay

### Quick Links

Three shortcut buttons that open directly:

- **Adobe Stock** — Opens `contributor.stock.adobe.com` upload page
- **Shutterstock** — Opens `submit.shutterstock.com` upload page
- **Local Files** — Opens the local file processing mode for offline metadata generation

### Activity Log

A real-time log showing all extension actions. Useful for:

- Confirming metadata was generated successfully
- Troubleshooting errors
- Tracking which images have been processed

You can clear the log by clicking the "Clear" button.

## Using the Extension: Adobe Stock Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Navigate to Adobe Stock uploads**

Go to [contributor.stock.adobe.com](https://contributor.stock.adobe.com/kr/uploads) and log in to your contributor account.

**2. Upload your images**

Upload your images through Adobe Stock's upload interface as you normally would.

**3. Select an image**

Click on a single image to open its metadata editing panel. You'll see the familiar title and keyword fields on the right side.

**4. Open TagStock Side Panel**

Click the TagStock icon in your Chrome toolbar. The Side Panel will open on the right side of your browser. The status should show "✅ Ready" if you're on the correct page.

**5. Generate and fill metadata**

You have two options:

- **Click the "Fill Metadata" button** in the Side Panel
- **Press `⌘E` (Mac) or `Ctrl+E` (Windows/Linux)** for faster access

**6. Review the results**

The AI will:
- Fill in the **title field** with a descriptive, natural-language title
- Fill in the **keyword field** with comma-separated keywords optimized for Adobe Stock
- Automatically click the **Save** button after a brief delay

**7. Move to the next image**

Click the next image in your upload queue and repeat the process. Each generation uses 1 credit.

### Adobe Stock Tips

- Adobe Stock supports up to 25 keywords—TagStock generates keywords within this limit
- Titles should be descriptive sentences, not keyword lists
- The extension reads the image directly from the Adobe Stock page, so no additional upload is needed

## Using the Extension: Shutterstock Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Navigate to Shutterstock Submit**

Go to [submit.shutterstock.com](https://submit.shutterstock.com/) and log in to your contributor account.

**2. Upload your content**

Upload your images through Shutterstock's submission interface.

**3. Select an image for editing**

Click on an uploaded image to open the editing view. You'll see the description and keyword input fields.

**4. Open TagStock Side Panel**

Click the TagStock extension icon. The status badge should show "✅ Ready" when on the Shutterstock upload page.

**5. Generate and fill metadata**

Use either:
- **"Fill Metadata" button** in the Side Panel
- **Keyboard shortcut `⌘E` / `Ctrl+E`**

**6. Review the results**

The extension handles Shutterstock's unique keyword input:
- **Description field** is filled with the AI-generated title
- **Keywords** are entered individually into Shutterstock's keyword input field, which requires single entries rather than comma-separated lists
- The extension simulates keyboard input to properly register each keyword
- **Auto-save** is triggered after completion

**7. Continue with your batch**

Select the next image and repeat. The extension maintains your authentication throughout the session.

### Shutterstock Tips

- Shutterstock allows up to 50 keywords—take advantage of the higher limit
- The keyword input system on Shutterstock works differently (individual entries), and TagStock handles this automatically
- Always review the generated description for accuracy

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The keyboard shortcut is the fastest way to use the extension:

| Shortcut | Platform | Action |
|----------|----------|--------|
| `⌘E` | Mac | Generate and fill metadata |
| `Ctrl+E` | Windows/Linux | Generate and fill metadata |

The shortcut works as long as:
- The TagStock Side Panel is open
- You're on a supported upload page
- An image is selected for editing
- You have remaining credits

## Troubleshooting

### "Unsupported Page" Status

**Problem:** The extension shows "Unsupported" status even though you're on Adobe Stock or Shutterstock.

**Solutions:**
- Make sure you're on the **upload/submission** page, not the main website
- For Adobe Stock: `contributor.stock.adobe.com/kr/uploads`
- For Shutterstock: `submit.shutterstock.com`
- Try refreshing the page

### Metadata Not Filling

**Problem:** You click "Fill Metadata" but nothing happens.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure an image is **selected** on the upload page (click on it first)
- Check that the Side Panel shows "✅ Ready" status
- Verify you have remaining credits
- Check the Activity Log for error messages

### Form Fields Not Detected

**Problem:** The extension can't find the title or keyword fields.

**Solutions:**
- Wait for the upload page to fully load before using the extension
- Don't modify the page with other extensions that might change the DOM
- Try refreshing the page and waiting 3-5 seconds before using TagStock

### Keyboard Shortcut Not Working

**Problem:** Pressing `⌘E` / `Ctrl+E` doesn't trigger metadata generation.

**Solutions:**
- Ensure the Side Panel is **open** (click the TagStock icon first)
- Click somewhere on the page first to ensure the page has focus
- Check that the shortcut isn't conflicting with another extension

### Credits Not Showing

**Problem:** Credit display shows "--" or "0".

**Solutions:**
- Try signing out and signing back in
- Check your subscription status at [tagstock.app/dashboard](/dashboard)
- Credits refresh monthly—check if your refresh date has passed

## Best Practices

### Batch Processing Workflow

For maximum efficiency, follow this workflow:

1. **Upload all images** to the stock platform first
2. **Open the Side Panel** once
3. **Process images sequentially** — select image → `⌘E` → review → next
4. **Don't switch tabs** while processing to maintain the Side Panel connection

### Quality Control

While the AI is highly accurate, always:

- **Check the title** — Does it accurately describe YOUR specific image?
- **Scan keywords** — Remove any that don't apply
- **Add specialty terms** — Include niche keywords the AI might miss
- **Verify formatting** — Ensure keywords look correct in the platform's UI

### Multi-Platform Strategy

If you upload to both Adobe Stock and Shutterstock:

1. Process all images on **one platform first**
2. Then switch to the **other platform** and process the same batch
3. The extension adapts metadata format automatically for each platform

A: Currently, TagStock supports Adobe Stock and Shutterstock. Support for additional platforms like iStock/Getty, 123RF, and Dreamstime is planned for future updates.
