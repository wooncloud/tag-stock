# Getting Started with TagStock

Welcome to TagStock, your AI-powered companion for stock photography metadata management. This guide will walk you through the essential features and best practices to maximize your workflow efficiency.

## Why Metadata Matters

In the competitive world of stock photography, **discoverability is everything**. Your stunning images won't sell if buyers can't find them. That's where proper keywording and metadata come in.

Stock agencies rely heavily on metadata to:

- Match buyer searches with relevant images
- Categorize your portfolio for browsing
- Determine image relevance in search results
- Filter content by usage rights and specifications

## Getting Your First Images Tagged

### Step 1: Upload Your Images

Navigate to the **Dashboard** and click the upload button. You can drag and drop multiple images at once, or click to browse your files.

```
Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP
Maximum file size: 25MB per image
Batch upload: Up to 50 images at once
```

### Step 2: Generate AI Keywords

Once uploaded, TagStock's AI analyzes your images and suggests relevant keywords. The process typically takes just a few seconds per image.

Our AI considers:

1. **Visual elements** - Objects, people, colors, composition
2. **Context** - Setting, mood, atmosphere
3. **Commercial relevance** - Business use cases, marketing themes
4. **Trending topics** - Current market demands

### Step 3: Review and Refine

While our AI is highly accurate, we recommend reviewing the suggested keywords:

- Remove any irrelevant suggestions
- Add niche-specific terms you know buyers search for
- Ensure proper spelling and formatting

> **Pro Tip:** Think like a buyer. What would someone searching for this type of image type into the search bar?

## Best Practices for Stock Photography

### Keyword Strategy

A solid keyword strategy includes:

- **Primary keywords** (5-10): Core subjects and themes
- **Secondary keywords** (10-20): Related concepts and variations
- **Long-tail keywords** (5-10): Specific phrases and combinations

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| Keyword stuffing | Reduces relevance score | Use 25-50 precise keywords |
| Generic terms only | High competition | Mix with specific terms |
| Spelling errors | Images not found | Always spell-check |
| Irrelevant keywords | Can get you banned | Be accurate and honest |

## Conclusion

TagStock streamlines the most tedious part of stock photography—the metadata. By combining AI intelligence with your creative expertise, you can spend less time on admin and more time behind the camera.
